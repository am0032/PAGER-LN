# PAGER-LN
This GitHub repository contains the code for a modern day pager. The pager utilizes a Telegram bot to send and receive data. It can scan for open WiFi networks and connect to them to transfer data, eliminating the need for a personal data plan. Additionally, the device's location can be tracked when an SOS signal is activated, as it can connect to open networks and most public WiFi networks include location information in the network name, providing a rough location and time which could be valuable in case of an emergency.
