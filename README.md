# PAGER-LN
This GitHub repository contains the code for a modern pager with advanced functionality. The pager utilizes a Telegram bot to send and receive data. It can scan for open WiFi networks and connect to them to transfer data, eliminating the need for a personal data plan. Additionally, the device's location can be tracked when an SOS signal is activated, as it can connect to open networks and most public WiFi networks include location information in the network name, providing a rough location and time.
Features:
1) Texting without a personal data connection
2)Rough tracking of the pager without without a gps module.
3)sending SOS signals


Future plans:
